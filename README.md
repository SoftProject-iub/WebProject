Login Page
Overview
This project is a simple web-based login page that allows users to input a username and password to authenticate. It is built with HTML, CSS providing a clean and responsive user interface for basic authentication purposes.
Features

Username Field: Accepts user input for the username or email.
Password Field: Securely accepts password input with a masked display.
Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes for mobile and desktop compatibility.
Basic Validation: Ensures fields are not empty before submission (client-side).

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/SoftProject-iub/WebProject.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd WebProject


Open the index.html file in a web browser:
No additional dependencies are required, as the project uses vanilla HTML, CSS.
Alternatively, serve the files using a local server (e.g., with VS Code Live Server or python -m http.server 8000).



Usage

Open index.html in a web browser.
Enter a username and password in the respective fields.
Click the "Login" button to submit the form.
The form includes client-side validation to check for empty fields.
(Note: This is a front-end only project; actual authentication requires a backend, not included in this scope.)


Example:
Username: testuser
Password: testpassword
